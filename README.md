# DevTome

DevTome is a small web application for keeping track of saved stories. It uses
plain JavaScript with a few helper scripts and Bootstrap for styling.

## Running Locally

This project relies on fetching HTML partials and ES modules. For the best results, serve the `DevTome` directory from a local web server instead of opening the files directly. You can start a simple server using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.
